      <description>Hi, I am a graduting Computer Engineer. This site is meant to be minimal, allowing myself to simply share my ideas with ease.
Any projects will be linked here with proper practical Demos /code and with research citations if applicable.
In this site I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing:
Useful development tutorials and best practices that I know of or learned recently. Courses and Books reviews, with simple enjoyable summaries (mostly techie stuff, but no promises) Briefs on studies,projects,research etc that I have done or peaked my interest.</description>
